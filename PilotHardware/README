The Prototype Min644P board for the BPilot is an ATMega644P 40 Pin Through hole based minimalist u_controler board.

It is the barest minimum needed to make the microcontroler work, the only bells and whistles are a debug LED and a power LED, both of these can be omited if minimum power drain is required. 


Notes:-

* It has no automatic reset, manual reset is needed to download to the board.
* It has no onboard USB to serial conversion so needs either an adapter or a USB/Serial Cable, the pin header on the board is set up for a FTDI USB to serial cable.
* The Bootloader runs at 115200 Baud
* To programe the board as a sanguino the easiest route is to use Nopheads Melzi 644p/1284p setup which he created for the Mendel90 this is all included here under the melzi folder.


Modifying Arduino IDE to use the Mezi config.

Setup your arduino IDE and check it works ok with a standard supported Arduino
Close the arduino IDE
Copy the Melzi folder from PilotFirmware to the arduino/hardware folder
Open the Arduino IDE and check that the boards selection now ncludes melzi 644 and melzi 1284
Select the melzi 644p option and use as per any other arduino.


Uploading code to the Min644P

It is manual reset so the reset pins need shorting with a jumper link.
Select download and as the compilation stage draws to an end remove the reset jumper.
Sometimes it can take a couple of go's to get them to talk but once they do downloading progresses OK.
If doing this a lot make up a push to make press button on a flying lead to the reset jumpers and use this as it is easier.
Reset is the two pins on the ICSP header that are parrallel to the top of the board.
